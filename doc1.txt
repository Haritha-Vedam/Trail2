This is my code written from main to induce merge conflict
will commit and try to merge

#Resolving commit manually
Writing a code in branch b1
Writing another code and will commit before switching branches
If i switch branches without commit the changes are going to be statshed in both branches

Adding again to create a merge conflict. 
Committed it already and creating another commit
